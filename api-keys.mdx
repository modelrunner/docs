## Retrieve and manage your API keys

Use API keys to authenticate requests to ModelRunner. Follow these steps to create a key, give it a clear name, copy it securely, and delete it when no longer needed.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Profile â†’ API Keys">
    Go to your account menu and select <strong>Profile</strong>, then open <strong>API Keys</strong>.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create API key">
    Click <strong>Create API key</strong>.

    <Tip>
    Prefer one key per environment or integration (for example: "staging-web", "prod-data-pipeline").
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name the key">
    Enter a descriptive name so you can identify usage later, then confirm to generate the key.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy the key">
    Copy the value and store it in a secure secrets manager or environment variable. You will use it in the <code>Authorization</code> header.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash cURL
    curl -X GET "https://queue.modelrunner.ai/{owner}/{model}/requests/{request_id}/status" \
      -H "Authorization: Key YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```

    ```javascript Node.js
    const res = await fetch(
      `https://queue.modelrunner.ai/${owner}/${model}/requests/${requestId}/status`,
      { headers: { Authorization: `Key ${process.env.MODELRUNNER_API_KEY}` } }
    );
    const data = await res.json();
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    <Warning>
    You can only view the full API key once at creation time. If lost, delete it and create a new one. Never share keys publicly or embed them in client-side code.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
Your API key is ready. Test it with a quick request and verify you receive a valid response.
</Check>

## Delete an API key

If an API key is no longer needed or has been exposed, you should delete it immediately to prevent unauthorized access.

To delete an API key:

- Go to the API Keys section in your profile.
- Find the key you want to remove.
- Click **Delete** and confirm your choice.

After deletion, any requests using that key will fail with a 401 Unauthorized error.

<Tip>
Regularly review and remove unused or compromised API keys to keep your account secure.
