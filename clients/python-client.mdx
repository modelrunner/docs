## Overview

ModelRunner provides a unified Python SDK to call any supported model with a consistent interface. Use it in scripts, services, and notebooks with both async and sync workflows.

<Callout>
For scripts and notebooks, never hardcode secrets. Use environment variables to manage your key securely.
</Callout>

## Installation

<CodeGroup>

```bash pip
pip install modelrunner-ai
```

```bash pip3
pip3 install modelrunner-ai
```

```bash poetry
poetry add modelrunner-ai
```

</CodeGroup>

## Configure credentials

Configure the client with a single key. Environment variables are recommended.

```bash
export MODELRUNNER_KEY=your-api-key
```

<Tip>
Get your credentials from your ModelRunner account. Keep them server-only and out of version control.
</Tip>


## Call a model

Leverage the queue for long-running tasks. Optionally listen to queue updates.

```python
import asyncio
import modelrunner_ai

async def main():
    response = await modelrunner_ai.submit_async(
        "bytedance/sdxl-lightning-4step",
        arguments={"prompt": "two friends cooking together"}
    )

    logs_index = 0
    async for event in response.iter_events(with_logs=True):
        if isinstance(event, modelrunner_ai.Queued):
            print("Queued. Position:", event.position)
        elif isinstance(event, (modelrunner_ai.InProgress, modelrunner_ai.Completed)):
            new_logs = event.logs[logs_index:]
            for log in new_logs:
                print(log["message"])
            logs_index = len(event.logs)

    result = await response.get()
    print(result["output"])

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Upload files

Upload local files to ModelRunner storage and receive a temporary URL you can pass to model inputs (for example, image or audio URLs).

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import modelrunner_ai

input_image = modelrunner_ai.upload_file("./image.jpg")
print(input_image)
response = modelrunner_ai.run("swook/inspyrenet", arguments={"image_path": input_image})
print(response["output"])
```
